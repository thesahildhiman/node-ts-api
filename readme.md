steps to install ts in nodejs-

1. install typescript, ts-node in dev mode
   - because it is used only in dev mode- after build all code is converted into js
   - ts-node internally converts ts files into js, and helps to run files
2. create ts-config file using command- npx tsc init
   - it controls how ts files converted into js files
3. install eslint
   - npm init @eslint/config
